                 <h2>Jane Addams: Pioneer for Social Change</h2>
                   <p>Suffragist, settlement house founder, peace activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, 
                      Jane Addams rejected marriage and motherhood in favor of a lifetime commitment to social reform.
                   </p>

                  <p>Addams and her friend, Ellen Gates Starr, traveled to England in 1881, where they were inspired 
                      by the famed Toynbee Hall in London—a special facility to help the poor. 
                     <br>In 1889, they moved into an old mansion in an immigrant neighborhood in Chicago, 
                      where Addams lived for the rest of her life.
                  </p>
                  <p>Hull-House, as it was named, provided a place for immigrants of diverse communities to gather. 
                     <br>Addams and other Hull-House residents sponsored legislation to abolish child labor, 
                      establish juvenile courts, limit the hours of working women, recognize labor unions, 
                      make school attendance compulsory and ensure safe working conditions in factories.

              <h2>Hedy Lamarr: Invented Tech Behind Wi-Fi</h2>
                   <p>Often called “The Most Beautiful Woman in Film,” Hedy Lamarr was more than what met the eye. 
                       While Lamarr’s screen presence made her one of the most popular actresses of her day, 
                       she was also an inventor with a sharp mind. Along with avant-garde composer George Anthiel, 
                       Lamarr developed a new method of “frequency hopping,” a technique for disguising radio transmissions
                       by making the signal jump between different channels in a prearranged pattern.
                     </p>

                     <p>Their “Secret Communication System” was created to combat Nazis during World War II, but the U.S. Navy ignored their findings. 
                         It wasn’t until years later that other inventors realized how groundbreaking the work was. 
                       <br>If you use a smartphone today, you can thank Lamarr—her communication system was a precursor to wireless technologies including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

              <h2>Jeannette Rankin: Broke Barriers Before Women Could Vote</h2>
               <p>The first woman elected to Congress in 1916, Jeannette Rankin didn’t always know she wanted to be in politics. 
                  Her political interest began when she returned to school in 1910 at the University of Washington in Seattle, and joined the state suffrage organization. 
                  Over the next four years, she spoke and lobbied for women’s suffrage.
               </p>

               <p>Ultimately serving two terms in the House, Rankin was the only member of Congress to vote against the U.S. participation in both World Wars. 
                  She also served as an officer for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom and campaigned for maternal and child health care and to the regulation of hours and wages of women workers.
               </p>
                <p>Continuing her pacifist traditions, Rankin helped form the “Jeannette Rankin Brigade,” 
                   a collection of some five thousand feminists, pacifists, students and others opposed to the Vietnam War.
